[MUSIC] Welcome to week four of the Estimation and Learning module in
the Robotics specialization. This week, we'll look at localization
algorithms for robotics. First of all, we'll explore how robots
represent the pose, that is where they're located and how they can estimate this
over time using a localization algorithm. Then, we'll see how, given a map,
we can use the information in the map to help us build up this
registration of the pose to the map. Finally, we'll explore a canonical
algorithm called the particle filter which robots can use to estimate their
localization information using sensors. In summary, this week you will learn how
robots can keep track of where they are in space and time using these particle filter
algorithms to represent their uncertainty.
